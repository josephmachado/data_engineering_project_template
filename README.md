# Data engineering project template

Detailed explanation can be found **[`in this post`](https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-projects-with-free-template/)**

## Prerequisites   

To use the template, please install the following. 

1. [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. [Github account](https://github.com/)
3. [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) 
4. [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) 
5. [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
6. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with at least 4GB of RAM and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v1.27.0 or later

If you are using windows please setup WSL and a local Ubuntu Virtual machine following **[the instructions here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)**. Install the above prerequisites on your ubuntu terminal, if you have trouble installing docker follow **[the steps here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04#step-1-installing-docker)**.

### Setup infra

You can create your GitHub repository based on this template by clicking on the `Use this template button in the **[data_engineering_project_template](https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_project_template)** repository. Clone your repository and replace content in the following files

1. **[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_project_template/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)**: In this file change the user id from `@josephmachado` to your Github user id.
2. **[cd.yml](https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_project_template/blob/main/.github/workflows/cd.yml)**: In this file change the `data_engineering_project_template` part of the `TARGET` parameter to your repository name.
3. **[variable.tf](https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_project_template/blob/main/terraform/variable.tf)**: In this file change the default values for `alert_email_id` and `repo_url` variables with your email and [github repository url](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-URL-find-use-example) respectively.

Run the following commands in your project directory.

```shell
# Local run & test
make up # start the docker containers on your computer & runs migrations under ./migrations
make ci # Runs auto formatting, lint checks, & all the test files under ./tests

# Create AWS services with Terraform
make tf-init # Only needed on your first terraform run (or if you add new providers)
make infra-up # type in yes after verifying the changes TF will make

# Wait until the EC2 instance is initialized, you can check this via your AWS UI
# See "Status Check" on the EC2 console, it should be "2/2 checks passed" before proceeding
# Wait another 5 mins, Airflow takes a while to start up

make cloud-airflow # this command will forward Airflow port from EC2 to your machine and opens it in the browser
# the user name and password are both airflow

make cloud-metabase # this command will forward Metabase port from EC2 to your machine and opens it in the browser
# use https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_project_template/blob/main/env file to connect to the warehouse from metabase
```

Database migrations can be created as shown below.

```shell
make db-migration # enter a description, e.g. create some schema
# make your changes to the newly created file under ./migrations
make warehouse-migration # to run the new migration on your warehouse
```

For the [continuous delivery](https://github.com/josephmachado/data_engineering_project_template/blob/main/.github/workflows/cd.yml) to work, set up the infrastructure with terraform, & defined the following repository secrets. You can set up the repository secrets by going to `Settings > Secrets > Actions > New repository secret`.

1. **`SERVER_SSH_KEY`**: We can get this by running `terraform -chdir=./terraform output -raw private_key` in the project directory and paste the entire content in a new Action secret called SERVER_SSH_KEY.
2. **`REMOTE_HOST`**: Get this by running `terraform -chdir=./terraform output -raw ec2_public_dns` in the project directory.
3. **`REMOTE_USER`**: The value for this is **ubuntu**.

### Tear down infra

After you are done, make sure to destroy your cloud infrastructure.

```shell
make down # Stop docker containers on your computer
make infra-down # type in yes after verifying the changes TF will make
```
